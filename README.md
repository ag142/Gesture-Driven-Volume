# Hand Gesture Volume Control

This project demonstrates a system for controlling audio volume using hand gestures captured through a webcam. The application utilizes computer vision techniques to recognize hand gestures and translate them into volume control commands.

## Features

- **Hand Gesture Recognition**: Uses computer vision (OpenCV) to detect and track hand gestures.
- **Volume Control**: Translates detected gestures into audio volume adjustments.
- **User Interface**: Simple graphical interface displaying real-time camera feed and volume level.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for the application.
- **OpenCV**: Library for computer vision tasks such as hand gesture recognition.
- **Pyttsx3**: Python library for text-to-speech conversion (optional for providing feedback).
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations in Python.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/HandGestureVolumeControl.git
   cd HandGestureVolumeControl
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Usage:**
   - Position your hand in front of the webcam.
   - Perform gestures (e.g., swipe up/down) to adjust the volume.
   - Check the real-time volume feedback on the UI.
